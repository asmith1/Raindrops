Raindrops Game
==============

When the program is openned, a start screen is displayed.

When the start button is clicked, you go to the game, where the catcher appears and raindrops and suns fall. The raindrops increase your score by a point and the suns decrease your score by three points. The raindrops fall slightly slower than the suns, but a raindrop falls once every 0.5 seconds whereas a sun falls once every 1.5 seconds.

Forty seconds after the game begins (after the start button is clicked), the end screen will appear. If you scored 50 points or more, Brian appears, and if you scored less than 50 points, he doesn't appear and you see a different message.

A "return to start screen" button appears on the end screen. If this button is clicked, you are brought back to the start screen. When the start button is clicked again, you are brought back to the game. However, there are few raindrops that fall the second game. In successive games no raindrops fall. This is the only major glitch in the game.

When I try to make the Sunshine and Raindrops arrays bigger, they overload my computer so I am unable to run the program. I think that if I were able to run the program with arrays at 1,000 or 10,000, my program would work, as long as no one sat all day long playing my game over and over again, until they went through all of the raindrops and suns.

Minor Glitches:
-I was unable to remove the background on all of my images so I made them black instead so you can't see them as they fall. However, if the raindrops or suns overlap as they fall, the black rectangular backgrounds can be visible.
-If a sun or raindrop is caught diagonally from the bucket, the black corner of the background on the picture can be seen.

Side Note: I did get permission from Brian to use the picture of him before putting it in my program. He is okay with it.

Raindrops Game
==============

When the program is openned, a start screen is displayed.

I tried to make it so that the timer for the raindrops to fall would not begin until the start button is clicked, but instead the timer starts right away. Thus, if you stay on the start screen for too long (a minute or longer), when you click the start button you will be brought to the end screen.

Otherwise you will go to the game, where the catcher will appear and raindrops and suns will fall. The raindrops increase your score by a point and the suns decrease your score by three points. The raindrops fall slightly slower than the suns, but a raindrop falls once ever 0.5 seconds whereas a sun falls once every 1.5 seconds.

A minute after the game is opened, the end screen will appear. If you scored more than 50 points, Brian appears, and if you scored less than 50 points, he doesn't appear and you see a different message.

I created the flowchart to show how the code would ideally run. However, when the start button is clicked after you click the return to start screen button after a game, you will be brought back to the end screen because I was unable to make the timer reset (unfortunately). The other glitch, that the timer starts right away rather than when the start button is clicked, is also not accounted for in the flowchart.

Minor Glitches:
-I was unable to remove the background on all of my images so I made them back instead. If the raindrops or suns overlap as they fall, the black rectangular backgrounds can be visible.
-If a sun or raindrop is caught diagonally from the bucket, the black corner of the background can be seen.

Side Note: I did get permission from Brian to use the picture of him before putting it in my program.
